# Integrating CareKit HyperProtect SDK for iOS with SampleApp

### _DRAFT_

_Goal_ : At the end of this section, you should have a fully running CareKit based app end-to-end that consumed IBM Hyper Protect Services
The SDK consists of 2 layers:

---

- The frontend Swift component that gets included in XCode
- The backend TypeScript server that acts as a mediator between the frontend and the database

// todo : Include Arch Diagram

// todo : inline NPM steps for backend

// todo : inline Swift code changes (+ XCode screenshots) for frontend
